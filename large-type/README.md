# [large-type.com](http://large-type.com) – Display and share text in a large font, directly from your browser

Large-type.com is a utility website that lets you **display & share text in a very large font** directly from your browser.

That's handy whenever you need to **read something on your screen from further away**—for example, phone numbers and passwords.

Even better, when you share text with large-type.com **only the person with the link sees your text**. Rendering happens locally on your browser and your text is not transmitted to any servers.
